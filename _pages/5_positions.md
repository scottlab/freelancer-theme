Unfortunately there are currently no openings for graduate students or postdoctoral fellows in the laboratory.  However, we are happy to endorse any scholarship applications for external funding for applicants, particularly those with shared research interests in genetics and genomics. 

Creative and eager summer students, international rotation students, and undergraduate students with independent funding or who are interested in volunteering are always welcome to enquire about potential opportunities.  If that is you, please [**email**](mailto:stuart.scott@mssm.edu) your updated CV directly and include a summary of your goals, research interests, and timeline.
