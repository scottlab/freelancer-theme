The Scott Laboratory acknowledges the continued collaboration with colleagues in the [Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences](http://icahn.mssm.edu/departments-and-institutes/genomics), the [Mount Sinai Genetic Testing Laboratory](http://icahn.mssm.edu/genetictesting), the [Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology](http://icahn.mssm.edu/departments-and-institutes/genomics) and the [Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine (IPM)](http://icahn.mssm.edu/research/institutes/ipm).  Ongoing research projects frequently involve the laboratories and expertise of [Drs. Robert J. Desnick](http://www.mountsinai.org/profiles/robert-j-desnick), [Inga Peter](http://icahn.mssm.edu/profiles/inga-peter), and [Jean-SÃ©bastien Hulot](http://icahn.mssm.edu/research/labs/hulot-laboratory) (from the [Cardiovascular Research Center](http://icahn.mssm.edu/research/centers/cardiovascular-research-center)) at [Mount Sinai](http://icahn.mssm.edu/).  

Research support has been provided by a [KL2 Faculty Scholar Award](http://icahn.mssm.edu/research/institutes/institutes-for-clinical-and-translational-sciences/education-and-career-development/kl2-faculty-scholars-awards) from the [Conduits Program at Mount Sinai](http://icahn.mssm.edu/research/institutes/institutes-for-clinical-and-translational-sciences), a [K23 Translational Scholar Career Award in Pharmacogenomics and Personalized Medicine](http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-11-009.html) from the [NIH/NIGMS](http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Pages/default.aspx) and [Pharmacogenomics Research Network (PGRN)](http://pgrn.org/display/pgrnwebsite/PGRN+Home), and through ongoing and productive collaborations with interested biotechnology companies.
