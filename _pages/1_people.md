**Stuart A. SCOTT, PhD**  

Stuart Scott got his PhD from the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, under the mentorship of hematopathologist [Dr. John F. DeCoteau](http://www.medicine.usask.ca/pathology/people/faculty/Full%20Time%20Faculty/DeCoteau%20John.php).  His interest in medical genetics and molecular pathology prompted postdoctoral [American Board of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ABMGG)](http://www.abmgg.org/) training in Clinical Molecular Genetics and Clinical Cytogenetics at the [Mount Sinai Genetic Testing Laboratory (MGTL)](http://icahn.mssm.edu/departments-and-institutes/genomics/genetic-testing) and Board certification in both specialties.  In the MGTL he is involved in high-complexity clinical molecular testing, including whole-genome array-based comparative genomic hybridization, whole-exome sequencing, and pharmacogenetic testing.  As above, Dr. Scott’s research interests are focused on translational molecular biology, particularly in the areas of pharmacogenomics, epigenomics and cytogenomics, and he considers himself fortunate to work with the people that he does.

**Yao YANG, PhD**  

Yao Yang got his PhD in Biomedical Engineering from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, before joining the Scott lab as a postdoctoral fellow in 2011.  His primary research interests involve the application and development of next-generation sequencing workflows and bioinformatic pipelines for discovery in the fields of epigenomics and pharmacogenomics.  Most recently, he developed **SMRT-BS**, a quantitative and multiplexed DNA methylation detection method using Pacific Biosciences long-read sequencing.  In addition to other collaborative research projects on multi-ethnic epigenomic profiling and population pharmacogenomics, Dr. Yang recently developed a novel variant calling pipeline for long-read amplicon sequencing, initially being validated on the highly polymorphic drug metabolism gene _CYP2D6_.

**Irene L. FENG**  

Irene Feng is an undergraduate student at Dartmouth College doing a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Computer Science/Biology.  She has been volunteering in the laboratory since February 2015, and under the direction of Ben Pullman, has focused her time on programming the user interface of our **High Throughput Methylation Analysis Program (HiTMAP)** for amplicon bisulfite sequencing data analysis.

**Jeffrey SLOAD**  

Jeff Sload initially volunteered in the Scott lab in 2012 in conjunction with the Authentic Science Research (ASR) program at Darien High School, which aimed at getting high school students first-hand scientific research experience.  Following completion of the program and graduation from Darien High School in 2013, he continued working in the lab on cardiovascular pharmacogenomics projects as a summer student.   He currently is studying Biology at Williams College and enjoys ultimate frisbee, jazz trombone, and the New York Rangers.

**Suparna MARTIS, PhD**  

Suparna Martis got her PhD form the University of Delhi in Peptide Chemistry and subsequently pursued postdoctoral research at the Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology (CSIR) and several Senior Scientist positions at genetics/genomics companies in Asia and North America, eventually landing at Mount Sinai as a postdoctoral fellow in 2010.  With a strong background in population pharmacogenetics, Dr. Martis lead a number of projects in the Scott Lab on multi-ethnic pharmacogenetic allele profiling and discovered several novel _CYP450_ variant alleles, including copy-number variants.

**Manishkumar PATEL, MS**  

Manishkumar Patel was a graduate student at the University of New Haven, CT, who did his MS thesis research project with Dr. Scott in 2009 entitled: ‘Warfarin Pharmacogenetics: Copy-Number Variation and Novel _CYP2C9_ Alleles in a Multi-ethnic Population.’  Following successful completion of his MS degree, he joined Mount Sinai as a Research Associate in a laboratory within the Department of Hematology & Medical Oncology.
