**Stuart A. SCOTT, PhD**  

Stuart Scott got his PhD from the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, under the mentorship of hematopathologist Dr. John F. DeCoteau.  His interest in medical genetics and molecular pathology prompted postdoctoral American Board of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ABMGG) training and Board certification in clinical molecular genetics and clinical cytogenetics at the Mount Sinai Genetic Testing Laboratory (MGTL).  In the MGTL he is involved in high-complexity clinical molecular testing, including whole-genome array-based comparative genomic hybridization, whole-exome sequencing, and pharmacogenetic testing.  As above, Dr. Scottâ€™s research interests are focused on translational molecular biology, particularly in the areas of pharmacogenomics, epigenomics and cytogenomics, and he considers himself fortunate to work with the people that he does.
