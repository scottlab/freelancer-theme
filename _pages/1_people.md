**Stuart A. SCOTT, PhD**  

Stuart Scott got his PhD from the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, under the mentorship of hematopathologist Dr. John F. DeCoteau.  His interest in medical genetics and molecular pathology prompted postdoctoral [American Board of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ABMGG)](http://www.abmgg.org/) training and Board certification in clinical molecular genetics and clinical cytogenetics at the [Mount Sinai Genetic Testing Laboratory (MGTL)](http://icahn.mssm.edu/departments-and-institutes/genomics/genetic-testing).  In the MGTL he is involved in high-complexity clinical molecular testing, including whole-genome array-based comparative genomic hybridization, whole-exome sequencing, and pharmacogenetic testing.  As above, Dr. Scottâ€™s research interests are focused on translational molecular biology, particularly in the areas of pharmacogenomics, epigenomics and cytogenomics, and he considers himself fortunate to work with the people that he does.
