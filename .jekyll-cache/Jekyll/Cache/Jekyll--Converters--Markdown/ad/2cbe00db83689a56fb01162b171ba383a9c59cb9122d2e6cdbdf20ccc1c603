I"ý<p>Yao YANG got his Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, before joining the SCOTT LAB as a postdoctoral fellow in 2011.  Dr. YANG became an Instructor in 2015 and his primary research interests involve the application and development of next-generation sequencing workflows and bioinformatic pipelines for discovery in epigenomics and pharmacogenomics.  He developed both <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25943404"><strong>SMRT-BS</strong></a>, a quantitative and multiplexed DNA methylation detection method using Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) long-read SMRT sequencing, and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26602992"><strong>long-read single molecule real-time full gene sequencing of <em>CYP2D6</em></strong></a> using PacBio.  In addition to other collaborative research projects on epigenomics and pharmacogenomics, Dr. YANG is also <a href="http://www.abmgg.org/"><strong>ABMGG</strong></a> certified in Clinical Molecular Genetics and Genomics and is developing novel variant calling pipelines for long-read sequencing. Dr. YANG is currently the Associate Director of the Stanford Medicine Clinical Genomics Laboratory and Clinical Assistant Professor in the Department of Pathology at Stanford University.</p>
