I"‹<p>A major focus of the SCOTT LAB is studying genetic determinants of interindividual drug response variability, with ongoing collaborative research projects on cardiovascular pharmacogenomics, multi-ethnic pharmacogenetic allele discovery, and the development of next-generation sequencing methods for pharmacogenomic research and clinical testing. Our group has made novel discoveries with anticoagulant and antiplatelet pharmacogenetics, characterized several novel <em>CYP450</em> alleles in various ethnic and racial groups, and participated in the NHLBI-supported COAG warfarin pharmacogenetics trial as a clinical site with the <strong>Mount Sinai Genetic Testing Laboratory</strong> (now the <a href="http://sema4.com">Sema4</a> Laboratory) and <a href="http://www.mountsinai.org/profiles/jonathan-l-halperin">Mount Sinai Cardiology</a>. In collaboration with next-generation sequencing companies, second and third generation high-throughput sequencing chemistries are being compared to interrogate pharmacogenomic gene panels.  In addition, together with the <a href="http://icahn.mssm.edu/research/institutes/ipm">Institute for Personalized Medicine (IPM)</a> at Mount Sinai, research projects are in development to interrogate the <a href="http://icahn.mssm.edu/research/institutes/ipm/programs/biome-biobank">Bio<i>Me</i> biobank</a> and patient electronic health records for pharmacogenomic discovery.</p>
