I"<p>Translating pharmacogenetic discovery to clinical implementation is an ongoing interest in the laboratory.  We are members of the <a href="https://www.cpicpgx.org">Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC)</a>, participating in authoring guidelines for pharmacogenetic-based drug therapy and other related initiatives.  An interdisciplinary group at Mount Sinai is continually assessing the evidence of gene/drug response associations and the potential clinical utility of pharmacogenetic-guided therapy.  As such, Dr. SCOTT is a Co-Investigator of the <a href="http://icahn.mssm.edu/research/institutes/ipm/programs/translational-initiatives-for-pharmacogenomics-tip">Institute for Personalized Medicineâ€™s (IPM)-PGx and eMERGE-PGx programs</a> by providing expertise in clinical genetics and implementing clinical pharmacogenetic testing at Mount Sinai.  Led by <a href="http://www.mountsinai.org/profiles/aniwaa-owusu-obeng">Dr. Aniwaa OWUSU OBENG</a>, the clinical pharmacogenetics implementation projects at IPM are preemptively genotyping a panel of pharmacogenetic variants through the <a href="http://sema4.com">Sema4</a> Laboratory among prospectively enrolled patients at selected Mount Sinai clinics as well as patients enrolled in the <a href="http://icahn.mssm.edu/research/institutes/ipm/programs/biome-biobank">Bio<i>Me</i> biobank</a>.  This program seeks to develop process best practices for successful translation of pharmacogenomics and personalized medicine discoveries into clinical practice.</p>
