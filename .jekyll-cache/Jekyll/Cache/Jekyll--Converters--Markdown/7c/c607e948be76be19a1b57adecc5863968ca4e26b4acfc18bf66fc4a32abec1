I"ç<p>Stuart SCOTT got his Ph.D. from the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, under the mentorship of hematopathologist <a href="http://medicine.usask.ca/profiles/pathology-and-laboratory-medicine/john-decoteau.php"><strong>Dr. John F. DECOTEAU</strong></a>.  His interest in medical genetics and molecular pathology prompted postdoctoral <a href="http://www.abmgg.org/"><strong>American Board of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ABMGG)</strong></a> training in Clinical Molecular Genetics and Clinical Cytogenetics and Genomics at the <a href="https://icahn.mssm.edu/education/residencies-fellowships/list/msh-clinical-genetics-laboratory-training"><strong>Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai</strong></a> and Board certification in both specialties.  In the <a href="http://sema4.com"><strong>Sema4</strong></a> Laboratory he was involved in high-complexity clinical molecular testing, including pharmacogenomics, cytogenomics, and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) long-read SMRT sequencing applications.  Dr. SCOTT is currently the Director of the Stanford Medicine Clinical Genomics Laboratory and Professor in the Department of Pathology at Stanford University. His research interests are focused on translational molecular biology, particularly in the areas of pharmacogenomics, cytogenomics, epigenomics, and genomic medicine implementation, and he considers himself fortunate to work with the people that he does.</p>
