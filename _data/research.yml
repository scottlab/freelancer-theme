overview: |
  The SCOTT LAB relocated in September 2020 from the [Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences](http://icahn.mssm.edu/departments-and-institutes/genomics) at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (and the [Sema4](http://sema4.com) laboratory) to the [Department of Pathology](https://med.stanford.edu/pathology.html) at **Stanford University**. Additional research updates will be be posted soon; however, interested students can reach out [directly](mailto:sascott@stanford.edu) to inquire about potential research opportunities.
    
  Any contribution to case reports on pediatric genetic disease are inspired by and dedicated to the memory of [Dr. James WEISFELD-ADAMS](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10545-018-0191-2) from the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Denver and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. Please consider a [donation](http://giving.mountsinai.org/goto/HonoringJames) to support the annual **James Weisfeld-Adams Memorial Grand Rounds** lecture at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York.

  - topic: PHARMACOGENETICS AND PHARMACOGENOMICS
    picture: research_pgx.png
    link: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23164804
    summary: |
      A major focus of the SCOTT LAB is studying genetic determinants of interindividual drug response variability, with ongoing collaborative research projects on cardiovascular pharmacogenomics, multi-ethnic pharmacogenetic allele discovery, and the development of next-generation sequencing methods for pharmacogenomic research and clinical testing. Our group has made novel discoveries with anticoagulant and antiplatelet pharmacogenetics, characterized several novel _CYP450_ alleles in various ethnic and racial groups, and participated in the NHLBI-supported COAG warfarin pharmacogenetics trial as a clinical site with the **Mount Sinai Genetic Testing Laboratory** (now the [Sema4](http://sema4.com) Laboratory) and [Mount Sinai Cardiology](http://www.mountsinai.org/profiles/jonathan-l-halperin). In collaboration with next-generation sequencing companies, second and third generation high-throughput sequencing chemistries are being compared to interrogate pharmacogenomic gene panels.  In addition, together with the [Institute for Personalized Medicine (IPM)](http://icahn.mssm.edu/research/institutes/ipm) at Mount Sinai, research projects are in development to interrogate the [Bio<i>Me</i> biobank](http://icahn.mssm.edu/research/institutes/ipm/programs/biome-biobank) and patient electronic health records for pharmacogenomic discovery.
  - topic: PERSONALIZED MEDICINE AND IMPLEMENTATION
    picture: research_implementation.png
    link: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22095251
    summary: |
      Translating pharmacogenetic discovery to clinical implementation is an ongoing interest in the laboratory.  We are members of the [Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC)](https://www.cpicpgx.org), participating in authoring guidelines for pharmacogenetic-based drug therapy and other related initiatives.  An interdisciplinary group at Mount Sinai is continually assessing the evidence of gene/drug response associations and the potential clinical utility of pharmacogenetic-guided therapy.  As such, Dr. SCOTT is a Co-Investigator of the [Institute for Personalized Medicine's (IPM)-PGx and eMERGE-PGx programs](http://icahn.mssm.edu/research/institutes/ipm/programs/translational-initiatives-for-pharmacogenomics-tip) by providing expertise in clinical genetics and implementing clinical pharmacogenetic testing at Mount Sinai.  Led by [Dr. Aniwaa OWUSU OBENG](http://www.mountsinai.org/profiles/aniwaa-owusu-obeng), the clinical pharmacogenetics implementation projects at IPM are preemptively genotyping a panel of pharmacogenetic variants through the [Sema4](http://sema4.com) Laboratory among prospectively enrolled patients at selected Mount Sinai clinics as well as patients enrolled in the [Bio<i>Me</i> biobank](http://icahn.mssm.edu/research/institutes/ipm/programs/biome-biobank).  This program seeks to develop process best practices for successful translation of pharmacogenomics and personalized medicine discoveries into clinical practice.
  - topic: EPIGENETICS AND EPIGENOMICS
    picture: research_epigenetics.png
    link: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25943404
    summary: |
      Another area of focus in the SCOTT LAB is the study of epigenetic DNA modifications and their role in disease pathogenesis.  Previous studies investigated promoter hypermethylation of mismatch repair and cell cycle genes implicated in leukemia pathogenesis; however, current efforts are aimed at studying germline epigenetic susceptibility to other common diseases and drug response phenotypes.  Additionally, we are interested in DNA methylation detection technologies, including microarray and next-generation sequencing chemistries.  Our group recently developed [single-molecule real-time bisulfite sequencing (SMRT-BS)](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/16/350), which is a novel quantitative and multiplexed bisulfite sequencing method for targeted CpG methylation analysis that employs the long-read lengths from Pacific Biosciences third-generation sequencing.  To facilitate the bioinformatic analysis of amplicon bisulfite next-generation sequencing, we are now in the process of launching [HiTMAP: a High Throughput Methylation Analysis Program](https://hitmap.stuartscottlab.org) for open access targeted bisulfite sequencing analyses.
  - topic: CLINICAL LABORATORY GENETICS and GENOMICS
    picture: research_clinicalgenetics.png
    link: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20672374
    summary: |
      Dr. SCOTT was one of the Directors of the [Sema4](http://sema4.com) Laboratory, which is a CLIA and New York State (NYS) approved and College of American Pathologists (CAP) accredited clinical genetics laboratory led by [Dr. Lisa EDELMANN](http://www.mountsinai.org/profiles/lisa-j-edelmann) with Biochemical Genetics, Cytogenetics and Cytogenomics, Molecular Genetics and Genomics, Pharmacogenomics, and Molecular Oncology subdivisions.  In addition to clinical genetic testing, the Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences at Mount Sinai has a large [American Board of Genetics and Genomics (ABMGG) accredited postdoctoral fellowship training program in clinical laboratory genetics](http://icahn.mssm.edu/departments-and-institutes/genetics-and-genomic-sciences/programs-and-training/medical-genetics-residency-and-fellowship-programs/diagnostic-clinical-genetics-laboratory-training-program).  As such, collaborative research projects with the ABMGG trainees are always ongoing and often centered on clinical molecular or cytogenomic case reports/studies, new test development and validation, analytical comparisons of genetic testing platforms, and multi-ethnic population screening.
