overview: |
  The SCOTT LAB relocated in September 2020 from the [Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences](http://icahn.mssm.edu/departments-and-institutes/genomics) at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai to the [Department of Pathology](https://med.stanford.edu/pathology.html) at **Stanford University**.  The central aim of the SCOTT LAB is studying genetic determinants of both drug response variability and Mendelian disease, including innovative sequencing and bioinformatic approaches for discovery and diagnostic testing, as well as assessing clinical provider perspectives on implementing genomic medicine.  Interested students and colleagues can reach out [directly](mailto:sascott@stanford.edu) to inquire about potential research opportunities. 
    
  All studies on pediatric genetic disease are dedicated to the memory of [Dr. James WEISFELD-ADAMS](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10545-018-0191-2) from the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Denver and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. Please consider a [donation](http://giving.mountsinai.org/goto/HonoringJames) to support the annual **James Weisfeld-Adams Memorial Grand Rounds** lecture at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York.

    summary: |
      A major focus of the SCOTT LAB is studying genetic determinants of interindividual drug response variability, with ongoing collaborative research projects on clinical pharmacogenomics, multi-ethnic pharmacogenomic allele discovery, and the development of next-generation sequencing methods for pharmacogenomic research and clinical testing. Our group has made novel discoveries with anticoagulant and antiplatelet pharmacogeomics, characterized novel _CYP450_ alleles in diverse populations, and developed innovative long-read sequencing pharmacogenomic assays in collaboration with [PacBio](https://www.pacb.com/) for translational research and clinical implementation. 
  - topic: GENOMIC MEDICINE IMPLEMENTATION

    summary: |
      Translating pharmacogenomic discovery to clinical implementation is an ongoing interest in the laboratory. We are members of the [Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC)](https://www.cpicpgx.org), participating in authoring guidelines for pharmacogenetic-based drug therapy and other related initiatives. Dr. SCOTT was a Co-Investigator of the [Institute for Personalized Medicine's (IPM)-PGx and eMERGE-PGx programs](http://icahn.mssm.edu/research/institutes/ipm/programs/translational-initiatives-for-pharmacogenomics-tip) by providing support in clinical genetics and implementing clinical pharmacogenomic testing at Mount Sinai. Current implementation efforts at **Stanford Medicine** are centered on partnering with [PharmGKB](https://www.pharmgkb.org/), the [Stanford Medicine Catalyst Program](https://smcatalyst.stanford.edu/), and clincial colleagues to develop and launch an innovative clinical pharmacogenomic program across Stanford Health Care.

    summary: |
      In addition to developing a novel long-read HiFi sequencing pharmacogenomics panel, translational research on antiplatelet response variability has been an ongoing area of focus for the SCOTT LAB, including implementing _CYP2C19_ genotyping for medication management. Previous work employed extreme phenotype exome sequencing to identify a [novel gene association with clopidogrel response](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27213804/), and current implementation efforts are leveraging [rapid turnaround time _CYP2C19_ genotyping](./img/pdfs/AMP_CYP2C19-SS11152023.pdf) to guide antiplatelet therapy decisions at the point-of-care.

    summary: |
     In 2020, Dr. SCOTT relocated from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai to the [Department of Pathology](https://med.stanford.edu/pathology.html) at **Stanford University** as Director of the Stanford Medicine Clinical Genomics Laboratory. As such, collaborative research projects with clinical colleagues and trainees are always ongoing and frequently centered on clinical molecular or cytogenomic case studies, novel gene discovery, innovative genomic test development, and analytical comparisons of genomic testing platforms. Translational partnerships with innovative commercial companies that support genomic diagnostics are welcome, as an additional aim of the SCOTT LAB and the Clinical Genomics Laboratory is supporting research programs centered on Mendelian and/or complex disease genomics. 
  - topic: EPIGENETICS AND EPIGENOMICS
    picture: research_epigenetics.png
    link: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25943404
    summary: |
      Another area of focus in the SCOTT LAB is the study of epigenetic DNA modifications and their role in disease pathogenesis.  Previous studies investigated promoter hypermethylation of mismatch repair and cell cycle genes implicated in leukemia pathogenesis; however, current efforts are aimed at studying germline epigenetic susceptibility to common diseases and drug response phenotypes.  Our group developed [single-molecule real-time bisulfite sequencing (SMRT-BS)](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/16/350), which is a novel quantitative and multiplexed bisulfite sequencing method for targeted CpG methylation analysis that employs long-read HiFi sequencing.
