title: The <em>CYP2D6</em> VCF TRANSLATOR
home: |
  The ***CYP2D6* variant call format (VCF) Translator** (v1.0) converts *CYP2D6* sequence variants from human genome assembly GRCh37/hg19 coordinates to the [M33388](M33388) and [AY545216](AY545216) GenBank reference sequence coordinates, which are more commonly used for star (*) allele conversion.

  **Key features:**

  - The input is a standard VCF file (.vcf) with a file head and 10 columns (#CHROM, POS, ID, REF, ALT, QUAL, FILTER, INFO, FORMAT, SAMPLE) limited to the full gene CYP2D6 coordinates from human genome reference hg19 (chr22:42522071-42528563).
  - The [M33388](M33388) and [AY545216](AY545216) GenBank reference sequences have been modified to include the *CYP2D6* nucleotide corrections indicated by the [**Human Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Allele Nomenclature Database**](P450).
  - Corrects for the CYP2D6*2 haplotype variants present in the hg19 human genome reference build (e.g., intron 1 conversion, 1661G>C, 2850C>T, 4180G>C, etc.).
  - Coordinates and variant annotation can be downloaded as a tab delimited .txt file.

    1. Click 'Browse' to identify and select a local VCF file (.vcf).
    2. Click 'Run'.
    3. Click 'Open the file' to view the results onscreen or select 'Download the tab-delimited file' to download the .txt results file to a local drive.
    4. Click 'Go Back' to return to the homepage.

    **Notes:**

    - The #CHROM, POS, and SAMPLE columns of a VCF file are essential to run the ***CYP2D6* VCF Translator.**
    - The input range of the POS field is limited to the full gene *CYP2D6* coordinates from human genome reference **[GRCh37/hg19 (chr22:42522071-42528563)](http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=hg19&position=chr22%3A42522071-42528563&hgsid=452868401_q42AOxxCDdLcq5dlu6TtOgJ8JG3C)**.
    - The *CYP2D6* gene sequence of the hg19 genome reference build contains many common CYP2D62 variants.  Therefore, all CYP2D62 variants not called in a VCF because they are homozygous reference in hg19 are annotated in the output file as ‘mutant or not sequenced’.
