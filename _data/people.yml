      bio: |
         Stuart SCOTT got his Ph.D. from the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, under the mentorship of hematopathologist [**Dr. John F. DECOTEAU**](http://medicine.usask.ca/profiles/pathology-and-laboratory-medicine/john-decoteau.php).  His interest in medical genetics and molecular pathology prompted postdoctoral [**American Board of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ABMGG)**](http://www.abmgg.org/) training in Clinical Molecular Genetics and Clinical Cytogenetics at the [**Mount Sinai Genetic Testing Laboratory (MGTL)**](http://icahn.mssm.edu/genetictesting) and Board certification in both specialties.  In the MGTL he is involved in high-complexity clinical molecular testing, including microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and pharmacogenetic targeted genotyping and sequencing.  Dr. SCOTT’s research interests are focused on translational molecular biology, particularly in the areas of pharmacogenomics, epigenomics and cytogenomics, and he considers himself fortunate to work with the people that he does.
