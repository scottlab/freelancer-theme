    - name: Stuart A. SCOTT, PhD
      bio: |
         Stuart Scott got his PhD from the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, under the mentorship of hematopathologist [**Dr. John F. DeCoteau**](http://www.medicine.usask.ca/pathology/people/faculty/Full%20Time%20Faculty/DeCoteau%20John.php).  His interest in medical genetics and molecular pathology prompted postdoctoral [**American Board of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ABMGG)**](http://www.abmgg.org/) training in Clinical Molecular Genetics and Clinical Cytogenetics at the [**Mount Sinai Genetic Testing Laboratory (MGTL)**](http://icahn.mssm.edu/departments-and-institutes/genomics/genetic-testing) and Board certification in both specialties.  In the MGTL he is involved in high-complexity clinical molecular testing, including whole-genome array-based comparative genomic hybridization, whole-exome sequencing, and pharmacogenetic testing.  As above, Dr. Scott’s research interests are focused on translational molecular biology, particularly in the areas of pharmacogenomics, epigenomics and cytogenomics, and he considers himself fortunate to work with the people that he does.

      bio: |
         Yao Yang got his PhD in Biomedical Engineering from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, before joining the Scott lab as a postdoctoral fellow in 2011.  His primary research interests involve the application and development of next-generation sequencing workflows and bioinformatic pipelines for discovery in the fields of epigenomics and pharmacogenomics.  Most recently, he developed [**SMRT-BS**](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/16/350), a quantitative and multiplexed DNA methylation detection method using Pacific Biosciences long-read sequencing.  In addition to other collaborative research projects on multi-ethnic epigenomic profiling and population pharmacogenomics, Dr. Yang recently developed a novel variant calling pipeline for long-read amplicon sequencing, initially being validated on the highly polymorphic drug metabolism gene _CYP2D6_.
    - name: Benjamin S. PULLMAN, BA

      bio: |
         Ben Pullman completed his Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Computer Science and Music at Amherst College in 2013, which included an honors thesis entitled Machine Learning Methods for Detecting Code Obfuscation.  He has been volunteering in the Scott Lab since 2014 while working as a developer for the social campaign around the film _Girl Rising_ and applying for graduate school.  During this time he has spearheaded our **High Throughput Methylation Analysis Program (HiTMAP)** project, which is a quantitative online tool for amplicon bisulfite sequencing DNA methylation analyses.  Although he will always be involved with HiTMAP, in August 2015 he will begin his Ph.D. program in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) in the Center for Computational Mass Spectrometry.

      bio: |
         Noura Abul-Husn is an Assistant Professor in Medicine and Genetics and Genomic Sciences, and is a member of the [**Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine (IPM)**](http://icahn.mssm.edu/research/institutes/ipm) and the [**Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology**](http://icahn.mssm.edu/genomics).  In addition to being a practicing clinical geneticist, [**Dr. Abul-Husn**](http://labs.icahn.mssm.edu/abul-husnlab) studies the role of rare genetic variants in common diseases and works with the Scott lab on pharmacogenomics discovery and clinical implementation projects.
    - name: Irene L. FENG
      bio: |
         Irene Feng is an undergraduate student at Dartmouth College doing a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Computer Science/Biology.  She has been volunteering in the laboratory since February 2015, and under the direction of Ben Pullman, has focused her time on programming the user interface of our **High Throughput Methylation Analysis Program (HiTMAP)** for amplicon bisulfite sequencing data analysis.

    - name: Jeffrey SLOAD
      bio: |
         Jeff Sload initially volunteered in the Scott lab in 2012 in conjunction with the Authentic Science Research (ASR) program at Darien High School, which aimed at getting high school students first-hand scientific research experience.  Following completion of the program and graduation from Darien High School in 2013, he continued working in the lab on cardiovascular pharmacogenomics projects as a summer student.   He currently is studying Biology at Williams College and enjoys ultimate frisbee, jazz trombone, and the New York Rangers.
    - name: Suparna MARTIS, PhD
      bio: |
         Suparna Martis got her PhD form the University of Delhi in Peptide Chemistry and subsequently pursued postdoctoral research at the Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology (CSIR) and several Senior Scientist positions at genetics/genomics companies in Asia and North America, eventually landing at Mount Sinai as a postdoctoral fellow in 2010.  With a strong background in population pharmacogenetics, Dr. Martis lead a number of projects in the Scott Lab on multi-ethnic pharmacogenetic allele profiling and discovered several novel _CYP450_ variant alleles, including copy-number variants.  
    - name: Manishkumar PATEL, MS
      bio: |
         Manishkumar Patel was a graduate student at the University of New Haven, CT, who did his MS thesis research project with Dr. Scott in 2009 entitled: ‘Warfarin Pharmacogenetics: Copy-Number Variation and Novel _CYP2C9_ Alleles in a Multi-ethnic Population.’  Following successful completion of his MS degree, he joined Mount Sinai as a Research Associate in a laboratory within the Department of Hematology & Medical Oncology.
